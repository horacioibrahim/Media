Chelmsford Makerspace is where people can come share ideas, tools and knowledge.  

It started out with just us getting together at Richard's house after school and during the holidays to play games and talk about random tech.

*Richard interjects*  
**Yeah, then we got to six people and my Mum kicked us out**

Inspired by all these hackspaces in Europe and America, Richard turned to me in school one day and said "We need a hackspace in Chelmsford."

After being turned down for a lot of places and a name change later, with me being a Scout young leader and Richard's Mum being a Cub leader, we got a good deal on the Galleywood Scout Hut here for one night a week.

So I just put out a call on Facebook and to friends, suddenly, we had 20 people out of almost nowhere.
That number more than doubled as we went on, we have X people here today, we hit our max capacity for the hut on our Raspberry Pi workshop and our Skype chat has over 9,000 messages daily with us just pinging things between us.

For people to go out and make things, there has to be that starter culture, a master spark so to speak that brings people in and gets them intrested.  
I would have never gotten intrested in any sort of computing if it hadn't been for my Dad giving me a computer with some intresting things that I then had to figure out myself, learn how it worked and when it broke, how to fix it.  

We all help each other here and we want to really go out and restore technology to the once amazing Chelmsford now that we're a city.  
We want to keep looking for others, we want to run more workshops, hackdays and events.  

Someone sent us a message one day saying we should come to this thing called Chelmsford City Camp so with no idea what to expect, I got together a small group including Ben and we just went.  
There we met quite a few people who were very helpful, we came out with a special grand award.

From City Camp, we got invited to open the Chelmsford Ideas Festival at the Ideas Hub, demonstrating what can be done through hacking and mashing up different technology.  
During that we ran and helped out with some workshops based around .net Gadgeteer, Raspberry Pi, Scratch, I did iPads for the older generation.  
What was stange about it was that we didn't get who we expected at all, at our events we had a lot of younger people at the weekends dropping in right up to retired engineers during the weekdays, an age range of eight to eighty!
